## Abstract
David Bowie might not be able to trace how time changes him, but with the Azure Cosmos DB change feed allows us to trace the changes to your data within your Cosmos database. The Azure Cosmos DB change feed listens to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes and then outputs the sorted lists of documents that were changed. In this session, you learn what the change feed is, how it works, and how you can use it to build more robust applications.

## Short Abstract
The Azure Cosmos DB change feed listens to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes and outputs the sorted lists of changed documents.  In this session, you learn the change feed, how it works, and how to use it to build more robust applications.

## Abstract
David Bowie might be unable to trace how time changes him, but the Azure Cosmos DB change feed allows us to trace the changes to your data within your Cosmos database. The Azure Cosmos DB change feed listens to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes and outputs the sorted lists of changed documents. In this session, you learn the change feed, how it works, and how to use it to build more robust applications.
